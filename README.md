This was a very fun educational test and I thank you for the oppurtunitiy to dig in here.

the only shown functionality on the page that is not totally working is the 5 day forecast,
I am getting a response from the api, but realized that key involved with that response was
more intricate than I could have put figured out in the time frame so I left it as is, tht said here is alot of stuff that could be done here using this as a base

Also the supplied config files had to be debugged as webpack had made some breaking changes since this was put together, and there was somethign going on with the svg breaking the program which when cured led to the webpack bug
so i had to throw some time into that to get it working, thanks

Also immediately after publishing this I started getting security errors from github regarding the api key used that is for my api account.

I understand there are a number of protocols needed to protect this key that would take some time to impliment but as this will not be here that long I am leaving it as is.

# Technical Assessment - Javascript and React

## Summary

The purpose of this short assessment is to gain some initial insight in to your
coding style, practices, thought processes, and attention to detail. It is
_not_ intended to be a strictly graded test with specific scores determining
a "pass" or "fail". Just focus on solving the problems outlined how you would
at your current or any other team.

Note that some of the user stories are ambiguous. There are many possible and/or
acceptable solutions to these problems. Use your best judgement to determine
what an appropriate solution is. It would be helpful to also demonstrate or 
explain how you came to your conclusions. You may be asked to explain your
solutions if it's not immediately clear what your reasoning was. Additionally,
you may be asked to pair with a Contently engineer to further expand on your
work.
