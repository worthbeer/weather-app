# Technical Assessment - Javascript and React

## Summary

The purpose of this short assessment is to gain some initial insight in to your
coding style, practices, thought processes, and attention to detail. It is
_not_ intended to be a strictly graded test with specific scores determining
a "pass" or "fail". Just focus on solving the problems outlined how you would
at your current or any other team.

Note that some of the user stories are ambiguous. There are many possible and/or
acceptable solutions to these problems. Use your best judgement to determine
what an appropriate solution is. It would be helpful to also demonstrate or 
explain how you came to your conclusions. You may be asked to explain your
solutions if it's not immediately clear what your reasoning was. Additionally,
you may be asked to pair with a Contently engineer to further expand on your
work.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this assessment. As engineers,
ourselves, we are sensitive to the time and energy it takes to go through this
process once, much less at numerous companies. Your interest is greatly
appreciated and we are excited to see if Contently is the next journey in your
